exploration_phase_ends_by is too low !! ( for off policy and pure off policy)

I haven't started config_ids from 1501 to 2100 inclusive.

I should clean the failed configs file (by removing the done ones, and relaunch the failed ones) - don't forget to clean models

TASK 1:
For the following runs:
2662
2661
2664
2663
the wandb logs are on my laptop, but they seem to not have synced to wandb. Fix this. Is there a way to see if it hasn't happened elsewhere ?


TASK1 OK  - It happened by itself
